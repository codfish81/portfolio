      <h3>My Scripture Journal</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created with the C# CRUD feature on the back-end and HTML on the front-end. It uses the SQL database to store the entries. I also styled the page with Bootstrap and a little CSS.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The page keeps track of any scriptures that stand out to the user by allowing the user to create an entry.</li>
        <li>The user enters the book, chapter, and verse of scripture.</li>
        <li>On the same page the user can enter and date and an entry on why they added that scripture to their journal page.</li>
        <li>An Index page shows all of the entries. The user can edit, delete, search, or order the list by date or by book title.</li>
      </ul>
